This is my first personal/portfolio:mortar_board: website which I developed:computer: during my winter vacations:santa::christmas_tree::santa:. Actually this project was started as a flutter web project oriented towards flutter animations deep dive but while developing this web app, I fell in love :heart_eyes: with it and transformed this into my professional personal website. It was an amazing experience while working on it and learning along with it.
